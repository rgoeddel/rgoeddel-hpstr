I've never really enjoyed web-dev. It always felt like too much like a chore.
Sure, I learned some basic HTML with everyone else in my middle/high school, but
after that, no efforts were made to apply those skills to my own space on the
web. No attempts were made to stay up-to-date as the use of CSS became
commonplace, nor PHP or JavaScript. This was not just a choice out of laziness;
not knowing anything about web-dev also meant that, when well-meaning friends
came looking for help with their own websites, I could honestly say I had no
idea how to help them. If making my own website seemed unappealing to me, I
certainly wanted no part in someone else's.

This lack of knowledge and competence always left me with a bitter taste in my
mouth, though. "I could learn this stuff if I wanted to," I'd tell myself. "I
just have better things to do with my time." Given the direction tech seems to
be going, though, and my chosen profession, it seemed like I was maybe doing
myself a disservice by not picking up at least a little of this stuff. Surely
I should at *least* be able to make a tolerable looking website.

The time finally came that I had no choice. Word came from on high that I had to
make some sort of professional website (read: my advisor made me do it).
Grudgingly, I spent a quick afternoon getting the gist of CSS and digging up
what I deemed an inoffensive template, registered a domain name, and voila: I
was on the web. It was gross, though. I wasn't proud of the final product. It
was pretty awful to work with, too. Adding "posts" was a tedious process, and
there wasn't really a way to handle archiving or indexing elegantly. It was
very much a hack job done under pressure.

For years since then, I've sworn to myself that I would take another stab at it,
but this time do it right. Well, here we are. This go-round, I'm fiddling with
<a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> and
<a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a>. After suffering a lot last time
trying to make my own, beautiful theme for my website, I am conceding
aesthetical defeat and going with a nice looking template out of the box. The
perk is, Jeykll makes this pretty freakin' easy. The notion of static webpages
appeals to me, too, so bonus points there. I haven't looked at Ruby is God knows
how long, but hey, maybe this will be a fun excuse to brush up a little, too.

For now, though, welcome to the new digs! It's going to take me a while to
get a handle on things and make this my own, but I'm already enjoying myself
immensely. Hope to see you around.
