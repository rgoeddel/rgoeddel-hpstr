**Abstract -**
Despite evidence that human wayfinders consider directions involving landmarks
or topological descriptions easier to follow, the majority of commerical
direction-planning services and GPS navigation units plan routes based on
metrically or temporally shortest paths, ignoring this potentially valuable
information. We propose a methodo for generating directions that maximizes
the probability of a human arriving at the correct destination, taking into
account a model of their ability to follow topological, metrical, and
landmark-based directions. We discuss optimization techniques for employing
these models and present a method, DART, for extracting model-improved sets
of directions in a tractable amount of time. DART employs particle simulation
techniques to maximize the probability that the modeled wayfinder will
successfully reach their destination. Our synthetic evaluation shows that DART
produces improvements in arrival rates over existing methods and illustrates
how DARTâ€™s directions reflect properties of the wayfinder model.
