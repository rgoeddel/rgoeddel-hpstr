**Abstract -**
Gathering intelligence about a potentially hostile environment is a critical
capability for war fighters. Using a team of robots for this task is an
attractive option because it allows data to be gathered quickly while
simultaneously removing humans from danger. However, fielding a team of robots
requires three key problems to be solved: first, the human commander must be
able to efficiently interact with the robots and issue orders that they can
understand; second, the system must be able to decompose orders into tasks for
individual robots; and third, the robots must have the perceptual capabilities
needed to operate for extended periods of time without operator assistance. In
this paper, we present our solutions to these problems, and demonstrate our
approaches using our test-bed which allows a single operator to control fifteen
robots.
